# [Requesty](https://vityavv.github.io/requesty)
A simple web interface for making requests using the fetch API

### How it works
This project uses the JavaScript Fetch API to request. It takes user 
input in vanilla JS. No libraries were used in the making of this 
project.

### CLI?
Please tell me if I should make a CLI version of this by opening an 
issue. I was going to but I decided against it because I thought people 
could just visit the site.
